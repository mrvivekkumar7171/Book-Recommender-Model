In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\",\n          \"9780020442608 The \\\"Dawn Treader\\\" is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries.

The journey takes Edmund, Lucy, and their cousin Eustace to the Eastern Islands, beyond the Silver Sea, toward Aslan's country at the End of the World.

Their promise is written in the blood of the moon.\\\" -From the Koran, chap. 9, v. 112 The conflict between Islam and the West existed long before the destruction of the World Trade Center and the other events that recently touched America. It goes back hundreds, even thousands, of years. Yet the struggle is upon us now as never before. In this well-reasoned, accessible book, Middle East expert George Grant answers the troubling questions on many believers' minds. Who are the followers of Islam, and what do they believe? What could have motivated those who carried out the acts of terror on September 11? Why has there been tension between Islam and the West for centuries? What are the true meanings of terms such as Ji'had, Intifada, and Dhimma? And is there any hope for peace? The call upon believers now-as always-is to prepare and equip ourselves so that we may stand fast. The Blood of the Moon will help readers better understand the history of Islam and its struggle with the Western world, as well as how Christians can share the message of salvation through Jesus Christ with the followers of Allah.\",\n          \"Actor and fledgling writer Jimmy Zoole finds his life caught in downward spiral as his girlfriend leave him, he loses his job, his best friend is dead, and his apartment has been robbed twice, a situation that culiminates on New Year's Eve when Eddie, a bisexual burglar, returns once again.

decade, Gilead is an astonishingly imagined story of remarkable lives. John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.',\n"," 'labels': ['Fiction', 'Nonfiction'],\n"," 'scores': [0.8438267111778259, 0.15617327392101288]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"execution_count":11},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2024-12-19T08:48:34.899246Z","start_time":"2024-12-19T08:48:34.668296Z"},"id":"7db593c8c8658762","outputId":"aaec9c2d-3e99-4be5-d58c-91b41a9a9b68","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742667012165,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Vivek Prasad Kushwaha","userId":"14789357975430695103"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# argmax will take the maximum scores only and return the index of that the maximum probability\n","max_index = np.argmax(pipe(sequence, fiction_categories)[\"scores\"])\n","max_label = pipe(sequence, fiction_categories)[\"labels\"][max_index]\n","max_label"],"id":"7db593c8c8658762","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Fiction'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}],"execution_count":12},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2024-12-19T08:50:12.761431Z","start_time":"2024-12-19T08:50:12.759289Z"},"id":"78b5bf4bf4a74fda","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742667012165,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Vivek Prasad Kushwaha","userId":"14789357975430695103"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# creating a function to lable all the description\n","def generate_predictions(sequence, categories):\n","    predictions = pipe(sequence, categories)\n","    max_index = np.argmax(predictions[\"scores\"])\n","    max_label = predictions[\"labels\"][max_index]\n","    return max_label"],"id":"78b5bf4bf4a74fda","outputs":[],"execution_count":13},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2024-12-19T08:54:02.840824Z","start_time":"2024-12-19T08:53:17.030562Z"},"id":"1d1593f7feefdb08","outputId":"e536fef8-9f91-4063-edda-19c63b447a40","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742667036997,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24840,"user":{"displayName":"Vivek Prasad Kushwaha","userId":"14789357975430695103"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# comparing for llms performance on predicting the lable by testing on the description for which we already have label.\n","actual_cats = []\n","predicted_cats = []\n","\n","for i in tqdm(range(0, 300)):\n","    sequence = books.loc[books[\"simple_categories\"] == \"Fiction\", \"description\"].reset_index(drop=True)[i]\n","    predicted_cats += [generate_predictions(sequence, fiction_categories)]\n","    actual_cats += [\"Fiction\"]"],"id":"1d1593f7feefdb08","outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["  2%|▏         | 6/300 [00:00<00:37,  7.90it/s]You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU.

In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\",\n          \"9780020442608 The \\\"Dawn Treader\\\" is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries.

The journey takes Edmund, Lucy, and their cousin Eustace to the Eastern Islands, beyond the Silver Sea, toward Aslan's country at the End of the World.
